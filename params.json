This site is designed to collect bird observational data at schools and share these observations with others upstream including IFWIS, NatureServe and the Cornell Bird Observatory.  The program is designed to excite children about birding, science and the outdoors.  Students or teachers (depending on grade level) report what they see out their windows and receive lessons from Fish and Game Biologists.\r\n\r\n### Make it your Own\r\nFeel free to clone this repository to build your own site.  At this time it is largely standalone, but through web services we hope to better integrate this website into other existing observations platforms.  The code is all GPLv2 licensed (Open Source) built on top of the Drupal platform.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
