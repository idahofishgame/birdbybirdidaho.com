This site is designed to collect bird observational data at schools and share these observations with others upstream including the [Idaho Fish and Game Species Diversity Database](https://fishandgame.idaho.gov/species), [NatureServe](http://natureserve.org) and the [Cornell Bird Observatory](http://ebird.org).  The program is designed to excite children about birding, science and the outdoors.  Students or teachers (depending on grade level) report what they see out their windows and receive lessons from wildlife biologists.\r\n\r\n### Make it your Own\r\nFeel free to clone this repository to build your own site.
